# ðŸ“Š Cohort Analysis in SQL

Welcome to the Cohort Analysis in SQL project! This repository contains SQL scripts that demonstrate how to perform cohort analysis and customer retention analysis on retail sales data.

## ðŸ—‚ Project Structure

- `Cohort Analysis in SQL.sql`: Main SQL script containing the cohort analysis implementation.
- `Online Retail.csv`: Raw retail transaction dataset.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective

The goal of this project is to analyze customer behavior and revenue patterns over time using cohort analysis techniques in SQL. This helps businesses understand customer retention and revenue trends across different customer cohorts.

## ðŸ›  Tools & Technologies Used

- **SQL** (MySQL compatible)
- Cohort analysis techniques
- Window functions
- Date manipulation
- Data aggregation

## ðŸ”‘ Key Concepts Covered

- Customer cohort identification
- Retention rate calculation
- Revenue trend analysis by cohort
- Time-based cohort comparisons
- Data cleaning and preparation for analysis

## ðŸ’¼ Use Case

Cohort analysis is essential for:
- Understanding customer lifecycle
- Measuring marketing campaign effectiveness
- Identifying customer retention patterns
- Analyzing revenue trends over time
- Making data-driven business decisions about customer engagement strategies

## ðŸ“ˆ Results Interpretation

The analysis provides two main views:
